from .celery import app as celery_app

__all__ = ("celery_app",)

"""This code snippet seems to be from a Python package or module, typically used in a Django project for configuring Celery.

from .celery import app as celery_app: This line imports the Celery instance named app from a file/module named celery within the current package or module directory. The as celery_app part renames the imported app object to celery_app, making it accessible within this module.

__all__ = ("celery_app",): This line defines the __all__ attribute, which is a list containing the string "celery_app". In Python, __all__ is a special attribute used in modules to specify what symbols (variables, functions, etc.) should be exported when from module_name import * is used.

In this context, when other modules or packages import symbols using from this_module import *, only celery_app will be imported, as it's the only symbol listed in the __all__ attribute. This prevents importing all symbols defined in this module and limits it to just celery_app.

Overall, this setup is commonly used to provide a convenient way to export the Celery app instance (celery_app) from this module to other parts of the codebase, ensuring easy access to the Celery instance for setting up and executing asynchronous tasks."""
